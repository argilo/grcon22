GRCon 2022 CTF
==============

This repository contains the challenges I created for
[GRCon 2022](https://events.gnuradio.org/event/18/).

Although the competition period is over, most of the challenges are still up and
playable at [https://ctf-2022.gnuradio.org/](https://ctf-2022.gnuradio.org/).

Descriptions of the challenges in this repository can be found in a blog post: [Building challenges for the GRCon22 CTF](https://irrational.net/2022/10/04/building-challenges-for-the-grcon22-ctf/).
